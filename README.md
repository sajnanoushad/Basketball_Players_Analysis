**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze a dataset of basketball players to gain insights into various aspects such as team compositions, player positions, age distributions, salaries, and height conversions. The analysis involves several preprocessing steps, data transformations, graphical representations, and extracting key insights.

**Preprocessing Steps**
Random Height Assignment : Heights in the Height column were replaced with random numbers between 150 and 180 cm. This step is for testing purposes and ensures reproducibility by setting a random seed.

**Analysis Tasks**
Distribution of Employees Across Teams:

Calculate the percentage of employees for each team.
Identify teams with the highest and lowest percentages of employees.
Distribution of Employees Across Positions:

Analyze the number of players in different positions such as Shooting Guard, Power Forward, etc.
Determine which positions have the highest and lowest numbers of employees.
Age Distribution:

Identify the age group with the highest number of employees.
Observe the decline in employee numbers with increasing age.
Salary Analysis:

Examine the salary distributions across different teams.
Highlight teams with high concentrations of high-salary players.
Identify positions with the highest average salaries, such as Center, Point Guard, and Power Forward.
Graphical Representations

Correlation Between Age and Salary:
A scatter plot visualizes the correlation between players' ages and their salaries.
Different colors represent different teams, providing a clear comparison.

Distribution of Employees:
Bar charts or pie charts represent the distribution of employees across teams and positions.
